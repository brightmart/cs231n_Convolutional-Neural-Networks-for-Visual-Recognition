Q1: Image Captioning with Vanilla RNNs (40 points)

The IPython notebook RNN_Captioning.ipynb will walk you through the implementation of an image captioning system on MS-COCO using vanilla recurrent networks.

Q2: Image Captioning with LSTMs (35 points)

The IPython notebook LSTM_Captioning.ipynb will walk you through the implementation of Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) RNNs, and apply them to image captioning on MS-COCO.

Q3: Image Gradients: Saliency maps and Fooling Images (10 points)

The IPython notebook ImageGradients.ipynb will introduce the TinyImageNet dataset. You will use a pretrained model on this dataset to compute gradients with respect to the image,
 and use them to produce saliency maps and fooling images.

Q4: Image Generation: Classes, Inversion, DeepDream (15 points)

In the IPython notebook ImageGeneration.ipynb you will use the pretrained TinyImageNet model to generate images. In particular you will generate class visualizations and
 implement feature inversion and DeepDream.

Q5: Do something extra! (up to +10 points)

Given the components of the assignment, try to do something cool. Maybe there is some way to generate images that we did not implement in the assignment?
